The code found here probably isn't an example of 'Good' Perl 6 code.  It is
however an example of someone that knows Perl 5 reasonable well, attempting to
do something in Perl 6.

What I'm attempting to do is implement URI.pm from CPAN, more or less.
Probably less.  I'm using rfc3986 as a guide, along with the URI.pm
documentation.
